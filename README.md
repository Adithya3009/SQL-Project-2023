# SQL-Project-2023
Summary:
Database project for sports team management (2023)
This project involves creating a database to manage the team operations and an overview of statistics of players. I chose to
create a database that manages an IPL team operation where the database handles player information, player statistics and
various roles in the team. Created database schema using MySQL, designed tables for players, match schedules, and Player
and staff roles. Created ERDs to show relationships and database structure. Tested functions and accuracy of the schema so
that the schema can be reliable.
